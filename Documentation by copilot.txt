# Skript SMP Plugin Template Documentation

## Overview

This Skript template provides a foundation for a Minecraft SMP plugin, including:
- Entity blacklisting for damage prevention
- Custom item setup
- Player trust system with commands
- Ability system with cooldowns
- GUI for item giving
- Utility functions (e.g., stun, particle effects)

---

## Features

### 1. Entity Blacklist on Load

- On server load, adds "villager" and "turtle" to a blacklist variable (`{-BlackList::*}`).
- Sets up a custom item (stick with name, lore, and enchantment glint) in `{-Items::1}`.

### 2. Damage Prevention

- Cancels damage events for entities in the blacklist if the damage is caused by the plugin.

### 3. Stun Utility

- `stun(entity, number)`: Teleports the entity to itself every tick for the given number of ticks (as long as it's alive), effectively "stunning" it.

### 4. Player Join Initialization

- On player join, initializes cooldown variables for two abilities.
- Continuously decreases cooldowns every second while the player is online.

### 5. Trust System

#### Command: `/trust [add|remove|list] [player]`

- **add**: Adds a player to your trust list if not already trusted and not yourself.
- **remove**: Removes a player from your trust list.
- **list**: Lists all trusted players.
- Tab completion is provided for command arguments.

#### Variables:
- `{-TL::%uuid of player%::*}`: Stores UUIDs of trusted players.
- `{-TLN::%uuid of player%::*}`: Stores names of trusted players.

#### Usage Example:
- `/trust add <player>`
- `/trust remove <player>`
- `/trust list`

### 6. Ability System

#### Command: `/ability <1|2>`

- Triggers the player's ability if set and not on cooldown.
- Cooldowns are managed per player and ability slot.

#### Function: `doAbility(player, string, number)`

- Placeholder for custom ability logic.
- Customize the ability name and actions in this function.

### 7. Admin Command

#### Command: `/smpname <clearCooldowns|give>`

- `clearCooldowns`: Resets the player's ability cooldowns (OP only).
- `give`: Opens the item GUI for the player.

### 8. Item GUI

- Function `give_item(player)` opens a custom chest GUI with items.
- Items are displayed as stone by default; customize as needed.
- Clicking an item gives it to the player and plays a sound.

### 9. Particle Effects

#### Function: `circle(radius, location, fromcolor, tocolor, amount, size, spread)`

- Draws a circle of colored particles with a color transition.
- Example usage (uncommented in code):
	```
	#circle(4, location of player, red, blue, 4, 1, vector(0.1,0.1,0.1))
	```

---

## Customization

- **Abilities**: Edit the `doAbility` function to add your own ability logic.
- **Items**: Change the items in `give_item` to your custom items.
- **Blacklist**: Add or remove entity types in the blacklist as needed.
- **Particle Effects**: Use the `circle` function for custom visual effects.

---

## Notes

- Trust lists are stored per player using UUIDs.
- The GUI and particle functions use Skript's advanced features; ensure your server has the required Skript addons.

For further customization, edit the relevant sections in your Skript file. If you need more advanced features, consider using Skript addons or integrating with other plugins.
